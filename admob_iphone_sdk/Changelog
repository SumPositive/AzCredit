    HOW TO UPGRADE PROJECTS WITH 2.X SUPPORT TO THIS RELEASE:
      * Copy all new .h files and libAdMob.a into your project to replace the old AdMob SDK
      * Delete references to libAdMobDevice.a and libAdMobSimulator.a
      * Drag the TouchJSON source directory into the project
      * In the Info page for the project, under the Build tab:
         * Make sure the "Base SDK" is set to "iPhone Device 3.0" or above (not 2.x)
         * Set "iPhone OS Deployment Target" to the minimum supported version such as "iPhone OS 2.2.1"
      * In the Info page for each Target, under the General tab:
         * Make sure libAdMobDevice.a and libAdMobSimulator.a are deleted
         * If missing add the MessageUI.framework and set the Type column to "Weak"

Version: 2009-11-19
-------------------

* Fixed: bugs in in-app video player
* No longer respect "test mode" if iTunes metadata is detected with the assumption being an application was accidentally submitted to the App Store with test mode still active

      - (void)presentWebView:(NSURL *)adLandingPage;

Version: 2009-04-02
--------------------
* Added a version method to AdMobView to be able easily determine the version of the binary.

* Added support for a click-to-contacts ad unit.
* Location is only ascertained once every 24 hours (instead of every 5 minutes) to conserve CPU and battery.
* User is shown a dialog before making a click-to-call phone call to prevent accidental phone calls.
* i18n: translation support for all strings present in the AdMob SDK. Will initially support the same languages as www.admob.com.
* Fixed: Dismissing an embedded browser when the keyboard is up no longer causes a crash. (This is actually a workaround
  a UIWebView bug.) Thanks to Aaron Miller for the bug report.
* Minor documentation clarifications.

Version: 2009-02-03
--------------------
* Added no thumb device build.
* Fixed: When a transform was applied to an AdMobView, touch detection did not occur correctly.
  IMPORTANT: If you are applying transforms to your AdMobView, this fix may cause the ad to render in a different
  location than it used to! Please double check your ad placement!
* Fixed: Under rare race conditions, rogue timers could in theory cause crashes. (No reports of this occurring, just being careful.)
* Code cleanup to prevent URL download memory leaks. (None actually occur with code as it exists, just do things right so they don't arise in the future.)
* Fixed: Location updating code was not always respecting cache ttls.
* Improved AppStore/iTunes link detection in embedded browser.
* Fixed: If the AdMobView was released while a user was using the embedded browser, some actions would cause a crash.
* Tweaked the UI of the embedded browser to better follow Apple HIGs.
* Sometimes on the simulator a UUID is not available -- handle that more gracefully.
* Started changelog. :)
